# highway-hackpad

i have created a hackpad with six buttons that allows you to pause/play, raise and lower the volume, skip forwards and backwards, and open the calculator. 

 my BOM is a Seeed XIAO RP2040, 6 Blank DSA keycaps, and 4 M3x16mm screws

 here is my hackpad case, which i can print myself
